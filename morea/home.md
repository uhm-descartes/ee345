## Welcome to EE 342, Fall 2023

EE 342 is an undergraduate level introduction to Probability and Statistics
for Electrical and Computer Engineering students.


## Who should take this course

This course is intended for undergraduates in ECE, or graduate
students in ICS, Economics, or Business with a basic working
knowledge of python.

## Pedagogy

EE 342 is structured as a series of [modules](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/modules), each taking
approximately a week to complete. The course will operate in partially
flipped mode. We will spend class time partly in lectures, and partly
to do problems. The setup of the course assumes that you are
responsible for the readings/experiences as assigned before you come
to class. We reserve the class time for the harder or the more
important parts. Modules have:

  * [Prerequisites](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/prerequisites), describing skills you should have prior to starting the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/readings), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/experiences), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

## About the instructor

[Narayana Prasad Santhanam](https://ee.hawaii.edu/faculty/profile?usr=63) is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Hawaii. My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, information theory and statistics. A particular focus is on high dimensional and complex problems, that are not amenable to traditional statistical methods and guarantees.
