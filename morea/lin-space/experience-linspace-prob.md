# Problems in class

1. Suppose $$A$$ is a $$m\times n$$ matrix. 

	* If $$C$$ is a $$n\times n$$ matrix, show that the column space
      of $$AC$$ is a subset of the column space of $$A$$
	* When is the column space of $$AC$$ equal to the column space of $$A$$?
    * What is the column space of $$\begin{bmatrix} A & AC \end{bmatrix}$$?
	* Can you make statements analogous to the above about row spaces? 
    * The (row/column) space is preserved in each step of the Gaussian
      elimination procedure. (choose the correct answer, with an explanation)
	
2. **Linear Regression** This is an important result which we will
   need for linear regression in a future module. Show that the null
   space of a $$n\times p$$ matrix $$X$$ equals the null space of
   $$X^X$$. 

3. Let $$A$$ have rref $$R_1$$, and let $$A^T$$ have rref $$R_2$$. We will
   relate the fundamental spaces of $$A$$ to those of $$R_1$$ and $$R_2$$.

    * Convince yourself that $$R_1$$ and $$R_2$$ are not transposes of
      each other in general.
	* The column space of $$A$$ equals the (row/column) space of
      ($$R_1/R_2$$)?  (choose correct answers with explanations)
    * The row space of $$A$$ equals the (row/column) space of
      ($$R_1/R_2$$)?  (choose correct answers with explanations)
	* The right null space of $$A$$ equals the (left/right) null space
      of ($$R_1/R_2$$)?  (choose correct answers with explanations)
    * The left null space of $$A$$ equals the (left/right) null space
      of ($$R_1/R_2$$)?  (choose correct answers with explanations)
