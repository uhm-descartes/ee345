  * You understand what "closed under linear combinations" means
  * You know what a linear space is
  * You know the 4 fundamental spaces of a matrix: the row, column, left and right null spaces
  * $$\textrm{col}(A) = \{ A{\bf x} : \textrm{ all values of }{\bf x} \}$$ (column)
  * $$\textrm{null}(A) = \{ {\bf x} : A{\bf x} = {\bf 0} \}$$ (right null)
  * row space of $$A$$ $=$ col space of $$A^T$$
  * left null space of $$A$$ $=$ right null space of $$A^T$$
  * If $$A$$ is $$m\times n$$, number of coordinates of vectors in each of the spaces
