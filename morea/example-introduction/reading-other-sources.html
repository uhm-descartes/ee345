<div class="container">
  <p>Linear algebra is fundamentally important, but also subtle and very
misunderstood. This combination provides a market for a lot of
material online. There are YouTube videos, which admittedly can be way
more slick than your millennial, GenX or boomer professor can do in
class.</p>

<p>I watch Number Blocks with my toddler, and I know how useful these can
be. Past students have told me about 3blue1brown, Zach Star, Khan
Academy and I am sure there are many other resources. It is hard to
give an overview of all resources since there are so many of them. But
I did watch all the above videos on linear algebra so I could tell you
how to best use these resources.</p>

<p>The short (and unfortunately unkind) answer is that these are videos
you must see <em>before</em> you start the material in class. They are at
high school, not an undergraduate level. High school level is where
<em>you</em> think you understand, but your teacher (or the person making
these videos) also knows you have been gently lulled into thinking
so. You aren’t really expected to generalize, but redo what you have
been shown (maybe by changing a few numbers, etc). It has its utility,
because at that stage of development, giving you the confidence you
can do something is often more important than the content.</p>

<p>The answer is also unkind because high school instruction is very
variable. It is not your fault if you haven’t seen this before in high
school. It is not on you. But if you haven’t, as suggested in various
modules, please try to watch the videos at least before we take up the
content in class. You don’t have to understand everything, but you
should watch it. And then ask questions in class (reference
the video you watched, we will watch it together and I can comment).</p>

<p>There are also lecture notes and video recordings of undergrad or
graduate classes online. Obviously the previous comment (about being high
school level) does not apply to them. But the best use I can think of
for <em>all</em> these resources: <strong>watch these videos and use the content to
<em>challenge</em> me in class</strong>.</p>

<p>At the undergraduate level, you see the same topics all over again in
some of the more fundamental subjects. But this time you are more
capable, and so you can and should be challenged more. Instead of rote
learning and drill problems, the goal is to get you to think in these
formalisms. Some will tell you that you can pass an undergraduate
course with high school knowledge.  They would be right, and honestly,
there is rampant grade inflation (though not for the reasons you would
think—the reason for grade inflation is often the hope that it will
encourage you to learn <em>some</em> day if not today). But then you are not
getting out of this course what you can.</p>

<p>These fundamental topics are now presented in more powerful and deeper
ways, more in line with how “grown ups” do things. As a consequence,
the undergraduate level should reshape your world. You are still
protected from the true extent of how far we have gone in these topics
are (see the experiences in each module), but not as much as in high
school.</p>

<p>Each time you relearn these topics, it is neither comfortable nor is
it meant to be. But it will be wonderful if you have the attitude that
you have to figure these things out. If you do that, by the
undergraduate/beginning graduate level, you would have rewired your
thinking to include these topics.</p>
