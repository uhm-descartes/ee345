# Do not skip classes!


# In Class: What are your goals?

Ask questions and challenge the content. 

We will also have problem solving sessions (either part of some
classes, or sometimes the whole class). Break up into groups of 3-4
(we will settle on the team-size this based on class strength). If you
do not have a team, I will assign one for you. Once I am satisfied
with your solutions, I will have one of the team present the
solutions. To ensure everyone participates, only change teams when
every team has presented at least once (about once every two weeks).
