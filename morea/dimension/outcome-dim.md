  * Basis = Maximal linearly independent set
  * Natural coordinate basis for $${\mathbb R}^n$$: columns of $$I_n$$
  * Dimension of a linear space = Size of the basis
  * Identify basis for fundamental spaces of $$A$$ using (pivot)
    rows/columns of $$A$$, as well as non-zero rows/cols of rref($$A$$)
	and rref($$A^T$$)
  * Dimension of all fundamental spaces of $$A$$ in terms of rank and shape of $$A$$
