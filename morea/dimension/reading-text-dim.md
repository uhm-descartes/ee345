This continues our study of linear independence. The text goes a
little into abstract spaces where the elements are not vectors, but
functions. There is a little bit about solving differential equations
in general, namely casting a general solution as the sum of a
particular solution and the null space, analogous to what we did in
class for matrix solutions. In EE 213, and in differential equations
in general, you would pick one among all possible solutions
using boundary conditions. In the lab, you will see how in machine
learning, we pick one among all possible solutions using _regularization_,
in an effort to buy generalizability.
