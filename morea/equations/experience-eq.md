# Lab work

The following python notebook will write out code for doing the
Gaussian Elimination procedure. In this lab, you will return if a set
of linear equations have 0, 1 or infinite solutions. In a future lab,
you will return all solutions. Writing the code will step you through
all the different scenarios you will encounter when you go through
elimination.

# Submission Instructions
All lab reports are due 1 week after you finish the material in class. You
are welcome to take your TA's help or my help to do the labs, or to discuss
them in office hours.
