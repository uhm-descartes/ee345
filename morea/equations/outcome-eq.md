  * You understand linear combinations of (column) vectors can be represented as a matrix times the vector of coefficients
  * You can set up a system of equations to check if a vector is a linear combination of other vectors
  * You understand the Elimination algorithm to get to the Reduced Row Echelon Form
  * You understand that you find a pivot in a column during Elimination iff the column is not a linear combination of prior columns
  * You understand how Elimination can solve a set of equations
  * You can figure out how many solutions a system of linear equations has
  * You can implement Elimination using code
