Students misinterpret this part of the course (and all of MATH 307).
You are learning the Elimination algorithm not to mimic it. Please
note that no matter how well you can perform the Elimination
algorithm, a computer can do it better and faster than any of
us. State of the art solvers have sophisticated approaches for
numerical stability in addition. The point of learning the algorithm
is to relate it to other concepts, not just mimic it numerically.

What the computer does not know, and what you should, is the context:
why would you set up a system of equations, what it would imply, how
many solutions a system has, and how you can change equations to
ensure unique, infinite or no solutions. You should also realize how
the elimination algorithm leads to the $$LU$$ decomposition. Down the
line, we will also use this to understand determinants and other
concepts.
