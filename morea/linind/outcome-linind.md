  * Linear independence highlights the properties pivot columns have
  * $$\{ {\bf v}_1, \ldots, {\bf v}_n \}$$ are linearly independent if
    $$V= \begin{bmatrix} {\bf v}_1 & \cdots & {\bf v}_n
    \end{bmatrix}$$ has a pivot in every column
  * The set $$\{ {\bf v}_1, \ldots, {\bf v}_n \}$$ of linearly
    independent vectors in a linear space $${\mathcal L}$$ is maximal
    for $${\mathcal L}$$ if $$\{ {\bf v}_1, \ldots, {\bf v}_n, {\bf
    x}\}$$ becomes linearly _dependent_ for any other $$\bf x$$ from
    the space $$\mathcal L$$
  * Every vector of a linear space can be written uniquely as a linear
	combination of vectors from a maximally independent set of the linear space
  * Maximal linearly independent sets of a linear space $$=$$ basis
  * All bases/maximal linearly independent sets in a linear space have the
    same size
  * The size of a basis/maximal linearly independent set in a linear space
    is a fundamental property of the linear space, called its
    dimension
