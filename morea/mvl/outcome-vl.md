  * You are comfortable with the formal definition of vectors in
    $${\mathbb R}^n$$
  * You understand addition, scaling and linear combinations of vectors 
  * You recall the parallelogram law of addition/subtractions
  * You can visualize simple sets of linear combinations geometrically
    (in 2 and 3 dimensions)
  * You understand how to compute the dot product and lengths of vectors
  * You understand how the dot product between vectors correlates with
    angle between them (in 2 and 3 dimensions)
  * You know how to write a system of linear equations that checks if a
    vector can be written as a linear combination of other vectors.
  * You can write code in python+numpy to do all the above
