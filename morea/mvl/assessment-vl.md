# Quizzes 1 and 2

Please submit Quizzes 1 on Laulima as instructed by their respective
due date. Again, this is a refesher for thinking about _sets_ of
linear combinations, simple operations on vectors (linear
combinations, dot products and orthogonality). 

# Problems in class

1. Parallelogram Law: Prove that for any two vectors $$\x$$ and $$\y$$,

$$||\x+\y||^2 + ||\x-\y||^2 = 2 \Bigl(||\x||^2 + ||\y||^2\Bigr). $$

2. Show that if $$\x$$ and $$\y$$ are both orthogonal to $$\z$$, so is any linear combination of $$\x$$ and $$\y$$.

3. Is $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$$ a
