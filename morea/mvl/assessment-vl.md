# Quizzes 1 and 2

Please submit Quizzes 1 on Laulima as instructed by their respective
due date. Again, this is a refesher for thinking about _sets_ of
linear combinations, simple operations on vectors (linear
combinations, dot products and orthogonality). 

# Problems in class

1. Parallelogram Law: Prove that for any two vectors $${\bf x}$$ and $${\bf y}$$with the same number of coordinates, 
    $$||{\bf x}+{\bf y}||^2 + ||{\bf x}-{\bf y}||^2 = 2 \Bigl(||{\bf x}||^2 + ||{\bf y}||^2\Bigr). $$

2. Show that if $${\bf x}$$ and $${\bf y}$$ are both orthogonal to
   $$\bf z$$, then so is any linear combination of $${\bf x}$$ and
   $${\bf y}$$.

3. Is $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$$ a linear combination of 
$$\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$$ and $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$?

4. Prove Cauchy-Schwartz inequality: 

  $${\bf x}^T{\bf y} \le ||{\bf x}|| \,||{\bf y}||.$$

5. Let $${\bf w}\in{\mathbb R}^3$$. From your previous experience in geometry,
all points $${\bf x}\in{\mathbb R}^3$$ satisfying $${\bf w}^T{\bf x}=0$$ form a ___ (fill up the blank).
  
   What is the smallest possible distance of a point $${\bf z} \in {\mathbb R}^3$$ from any point $${\bf x}$$ satisfying $${\bf w}^T{\bf x} = 0$$?
