The whole course will be about linear combinations of vectors. 
We will look at progressively more sophisticated ways at looking
at them. It is important to note that a lot of our methods will
be applicable beyond vectors. In fact Fourier analysis in 
EE 315 happens to be a use of these approaches for function spaces
rather than vector spaces. 

In the text, read through 1.1 and 1.2. Parts of Chapter 1.3 will be
taken up later. Among the highlights in Chapter 1.3, expressing a
linear combination as matrix-vector (or vector-matrix) multiplication
is crucial, and is also covered in the lab problems.

To check if a vector is a linear combination of other vectors, we can
write out a system of linear equations to solve. The ability to write
it this way is crucial. We will emphasize this aspect in the next
module, but you probably already see it if you understand how linear
combinations are multiplications between matrices and vectors.

Solving linear equations, the section on the Inverse Matrix, Cyclic
Differences, Independence and Dependence are not important right
away. If you have not seen these concepts before, it is better to skip
them for now.

### A word on geometric reasoning
Students often crave visualizations of what is happening, and perhaps
it is the only way you think about vectors now.  But in a manner of
speaking, this is also something to unlearn. It does not mean forgetting
about what you know in geometry in 2- or 3-d. Rather it means distilling
this into axioms and thinking in terms of axioms (not visualizations).

The reason is that we will be dealing with vectors not with 2 or 3
coordinates, but with large numbers of coordinates (hundreds or
thousands in our examples in class, but usually tens of thousands,
millions, or billions, or even more in real life).  Higher dimensions
behave very differently from our intuition or drawings in 2- or 3-d.
Just geometry will not get us far.

To make the leap, you _have_ to develop a more axiomatic way of
thinking about vectors. It is hard in the beginning, but you _must_
drop the training wheels of literal geometric visualization.
Axiomatic rather than geometric thinking is the point of the course,
since it turns out to be far more powerful. In this module, we still
make a few comments on representations of addition, scaling, and
visualization of simple sets of linear combinations. But the emphasis
will be on the axioms that will take us quite far.

When you have no recourse to geometry, all you have to fall back on
are axioms underlying manipulating vectors and linear
combinations. You are very likely to feel uncomfortable with this
approach---even more so, if in this module, you do not pay attention
to axiomatic vector manipulation. 

Once you get a little familiar with axiomatic reasoning, we will
replace geometric visualization with a different sort of rendering
that captures the essence of this axiomatic approach without being a
true geometric representation.
