# Lab 0+1: Matrices, Vectors, and Linear Combinations

The following python [notebook](/morea/lab01.ipynb) that you will work
in the Lab runs you through basics of working with matrices in
python/numpy.

The exercises you submit focus on linear combinations, and gets you to
observe that matrix multiplication produces linear combinations. This
is the big takeaway, _all_ matrix multiplication is just a way of
tracking linear combinations. 


## Submission Instructions

All lab reports are due 1 week after you finish the material in
class. You are welcome to take your TA's help or my help to do the
labs, or to discuss this in office hours.
