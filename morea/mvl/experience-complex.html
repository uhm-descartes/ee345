  <h1 id="complex-numbers">Complex Numbers</h1>

<p>This is advanced material. It is a lot of fun to know and think about,
but you will not be tested in EE345 about any of the following.</p>

<p>Think of vectors in \({\mathbb R}^2\), that is vectors with 2
coordinates.  We saw the inner and outer products of these vectors (in
class and labs).  Specifically, the inner product takes two vectors in
\({\mathbb R}^2\) and outputs a real number, the outer product takes
two vectors in \({\mathbb R}^2\) and outputs a \(2\times 2\) matrix.</p>

<p>But could we define a “algebraic product” more aligned with our notion
of product of real numbers? What do we mean by it? Well, let us list
out what properties we would like such a “algebraic product” to have:</p>

<p>The “algebraic product” should take any two vectors \({\bf x} \in
{\mathbb R}^2\), and \({\bf y}\in {\mathbb R}^2\) (the vectors could
possibly be equal) and output another vector \({\bf z} \in {\mathbb
R}^2\) with 2 coordinates (just like the product of two real numbers
is also a real number).</p>

<ol>
  <li>The “algebraic product” must be commutative, that is \({\bf x} {\bf y} = {\bf y}
{\bf x}\) for all \({\bf x}\) and \({\bf y}\).</li>
  <li>The “algebraic product” is linear in each factor, namely
\(({\bf x}_1+{\bf x}_2){\bf y} = {\bf x}_1 {\bf y} + {\bf x}_2 {\bf y}\) and \({\bf x} ({\bf y}_1+{\bf y}_2) = {\bf x}{\bf y}_1+{\bf x}{\bf y}_2\), as well as for any real \(c\), \((c{\bf x}){\bf y} = c({\bf x}{\bf y})\) and
\({\bf x}(c{\bf y})=c({\bf x}{\bf y})\).</li>
  <li>The “algebraic product” is associative, that is \({\bf x}({\bf y}{\bf z}) = ({\bf x}{\bf y}){\bf z}\) (so
even though the product was a binary operator, we can actually
write expressions like \({\bf x}{\bf y}{\bf z}\) with no ambiguity).</li>
  <li>If \({\bf x}\ne 0\) and \({\bf y}\ne 0\), the “algebraic product” \({\bf x}{\bf y} \ne 0\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that real multiplication satisfies all these. The dot product
doesn’t output a vector (so point 3 is meaningless), and does not
satisfy 4 (the dot product of non-zero orthogonal vectors is 0. The
outer product again doesn’t output a vector (so point 3 is again
meaningless), does not satisfy 1, but satisfies 2 and 4.</p>

<p>So what form can this “algebraic product” take? First it turns out
that the 4 axioms above imply (proof withheld but accessible) there
will be a unique identity vector \({\bf e}\), which satisfies for all
\({\bf x}\in{\mathbb R}^2\),</p>

\[{\bf x}{\bf e} = {\bf e}{\bf x} = {\bf x}.\]

<p>Then it turns out the 4 axioms above also imply that (proof withheld,
but you need to finish at least the first half of EE 345 to follow)
that there exists a vector \({\bf i}\in{\mathbb R}^2\) such that</p>

\[{\bf i}{\bf i} = (-{\bf i})(-{\bf i}) = -{\bf e}.\]

<p>These vectors \({\bf e}\) and \({\bf i}\) will not be scalings of each
other.  This is because if they were, ie \({\bf i} = c {\bf e}\), then
the linearity axiom implies</p>

\[-{\bf e} = {\bf i}{\bf i} = c^2 {\bf e}{\bf e} = c^2{\bf e}.\]

<p>But \(c^2{\bf e}\) can never equal \(-{\bf e}\) for any real
\(c\). Since \(\bf i\) and \(\bf e\) are not colinear, the set of all
linear combinations of \({\bf e}\) and \({\bf i}\) is the entire plane
\({\mathbb R}^2\) of all vectors with 2 coordinates. We can therefore
represent any vector \({\bf x}\) as \(x_1 {\bf e} + x_2 {\bf
i}\). Similarly, say \({\bf y}=y_1{\bf e} +y_2{\bf i}\) in the same
coordinate system. Then the 4 axioms imply that the product must
assign (this you can prove using axiom 2. above):</p>

\[{\bf x}{\bf y} = (x_1y_1 -x_2y_2 ){\bf e} + (x_2y_1+x_1y_2){\bf i}.\]

<p>If you are familiar with complex numbers, the above is the exact
analog of the development of complex numbers, a proof of the existence
of \(\sqrt{-1}\), and the development of the complex product. Now you
know why we represent complex numbers in the Argand/Gauss
plane—another way to see complex numbers is to think about how to
introduce an algebraic product on vectors with two coordinates.</p>

<p>If you ask, well what about real vectors with 3 or more coordinates?
On vectors with 3 coordinates such a product is impossible no matter
what we do. The <em>cross product</em> you have seen in physics comes close
however (but the cross product is neither associative nor
commutative).</p>

<p>Turns out there is a remarkable theorem called the <strong>Frobenius
theorem</strong> that states that only real multiplication on \({\mathbb R}\)
and the complex multiplication above on \({\mathbb R}^2\) satisfy the 4
properties above. If we compromise on commutativity, then \({\mathbb
R}^4\) (vectors with 4 coordinates) have an “algebraic product”
satisfying all but the commutative property. Just like \({\mathbb
R}^2\) are called complex numbers, \({\mathbb R}^4\) are called
quaternions.  Just as complex numbers are all over electrical
engineering, quaternions are all over computer vision, 3-d graphics,
not to mention the equations of Einstein’s General Relativity.</p>
