1. **Distance of a point from a plane** Let $${\bf w}\in{\mathbb R}^3$$. From your previous experience in geometry,
all points $${\bf x}\in{\mathbb R}^3$$ satisfying $${\bf w}^T{\bf x}=0$$ form a ___ (fill up the blank).
  
   What is the smallest possible distance of a point $${\bf z} \in {\mathbb R}^3$$ from any point $${\bf x}$$ satisfying $${\bf w}^T{\bf x} = 0$$?
