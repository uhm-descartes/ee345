  * Look for functions from square matrices to numbers
    satisfying three axioms (linear function of any row, if all others are held
    fixed; changes sign if rows exchanged; identity matrix assigned
    1)
  * Only one function satisfies all---that function is the determinant
  * If rows are linearly dependent, determinant is 0 (from axioms)
  * Determinant of lower/upper triangular or diagonal matrices: product of diagonal entries (from axioms)
  * determinant = product of pivots
  * Square $$A$$ invertible iff determinant($$A$$) $$=0$$ (follows from previous)
  * determinant$$(AB)$$ = determinant$$(A)$$ determinant$$(B)$$ (from axioms)
  * determinant$$(A)$$ = determinant$$(A^T)$$ (from elimination written in matrix form)
  * Recursive formula for determinants (from axioms)
  * Cramer's rule
