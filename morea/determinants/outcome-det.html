<ul>
  <li>Look for functions from square matrices to numbers
satisfying three axioms (linear function of any row, if all others are held
fixed; changes sign if rows exchanged; identity matrix assigned
1)</li>
  <li>Only one function satisfies all—that function is the determinant</li>
  <li>If rows are linearly dependent, determinant is 0 (from axioms)</li>
  <li>Determinant of lower/upper triangular or diagonal matrices: product of diagonal entries (from axioms)</li>
  <li>determinant = product of pivots</li>
  <li>Square \(A\) invertible iff determinant(\(A\)) \(=0\) (follows from previous)</li>
  <li>determinant\((AB)\) = determinant\((A)\) determinant\((B)\) (from axioms)</li>
  <li>determinant\((A)\) = determinant\((A^T)\) (from elimination written in matrix form)</li>
  <li>Recursive formula for determinants (from axioms)</li>
  <li>Cramer’s rule</li>
