# Problems in class

1. Is $$(A+B)^2 = A^2 + 2 AB + B^2?$$ If not, correct the equation.

2. Let $$A$$ be a $$3\times 3$$ matrix. Find a matrix $$E$$ such that all the conditions below are simultaneously satisfied
    * row two of $$EA$$ is (2 times row 1 of $$A$$ + row 2 of $$A$$),
	* the first and third rows of $$EA$$ equal the corresponding rows
of $$A$$.

4. Consider the plane of all linear combinations of the vectors
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\3 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$\begin{bmatrix}
3\\2\\1 \end{bmatrix}$$, where the three coordinates are interpreted
as the $$x-$$, $$y-$$ and $$z-$$ coordinates. How do we check if all
points on the $$x-$$axis lie in the plane?

5. Problem in text. For each row below, choose the only $$3\times 3$$ matrix $$B$$ such that
for all matrices $$A$$ the condition given in that row (answers may be different for different rows)
   * $$BA = 4A$$
   * $$BA = 4B$$
   * $$BA$$ has rows 1 and 3 of $$A$$ reversed, and row 2 unchanged
   * All rows of $$BA$$ are the same as row 1 of $$A$$
