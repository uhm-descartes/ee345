# Lab work

The following python [notebook](/ee345/morea/matrixmul/lab2.ipynb) that you will work
in the Lab runs you through basics of working with matrices in
python/numpy.

The exercises you submit are on linear combinations again, and like in
the previous module gets you to observe that matrix multiplication
produces linear combinations. This observation is **that** important
that both labs emphasize it. _All_ matrix multiplication is just a way
of tracking linear combinations. Here you also note that this concept
is simply the outer product way of multiplying matrices.


## Submission Instructions

All lab reports are due 1 week after you finish the material in
class. You are welcome to take your TA's help or my help to do the
labs, or to discuss this in office hours.
