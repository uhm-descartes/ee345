    "These \"generous interpretations\" built into numpy are called **broadcasting** rules. This often allows for simpler and more human readable/understandable code. The expansions are not arbitrary, and broadcasting cannot always make any two matrices compatible. Rather there are specific rules underlying broadcasting. They are:\n",

    "1. Compare the number of dimensions of each array, if one array dimension is shorter append 1d dimensions on the left until they are the same length.\n",

    "    2. If the array shapes do not match in a coordinate, but one of the array-shapes has a one in that coordinate, then that array is copied in that dimension to match the other array. For example, if you have (4,1) and (1,2) as the shapes of the two arrays (as one of the additions above). The first coordinate of the shapes has a 4 and a 1 respectively. The second array is therefore repeated along this dimension 4 times. The second coordinate of the shapes have a 1 and a 2. Now the first array is repeated along this dimension 2 times. So the eventual broadcasted shape is 4x2. \n",
    "    3. If the array shapes do not match in a coordinate, and neither shape has one as the entry in that coordinate, then they are incompatible. So (4,3) and (2,3) are incompatible. \n",
    "\n",

    " 2x3x1 \n",

    "2x3x5\n",
