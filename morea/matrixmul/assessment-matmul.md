# Problems in class

1. Is $$(A+B)^2 = A^2 + 2 AB + B^2?$$ If not, write the correct rule.

2. Let $$A$$ be a $$3\times 3$$ matrix. Find a matrix $$E$$ such that 
    * row two of $$EA$$ is (2 times row 1 of $$A$$ + row 2 of $$A$$),
	* the first and third rows of $$EA$$ equal the corresponding rows
of $$A$$.

3. For the graph in class, write the adjacency matrix as instructed in
   class. 
       * How many paths of length 2 are there between vertex 1 and vertex 4?
	   * How many triangles are there in the graph?

4. Consider the plane formed by the vectors $$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\3
\end{bmatrix}$$ and $$\begin{bmatrix} 3\\2\\1 \end{bmatrix}$$, where
the three coordinates are interpreted as the $$x-$$, $$y-$$ and $$z-$$
coordinates. How do we check if all points on the $$x-$$axis lie in
the plane?

5. Problem in text. Choose the only $$3\times 3$$ matrix $$B$$ such that
for all matrices $$A$$, 
   * $$BA = 4A$$
   * $$BA = 4B$$
   * $$BA$$ has rows 1 and 3 of $$A$$ reversed, and row 2 unchanged
   * All rows of $$BA$$ are the same as row 1 of $$A$$
