The text focusses on general square matrices. In class, we simplify
the narrative by not worrying about general matrices, focussing instead
only on symmetric matrices. 

We motivated eigenvalues with two demos: the best line that captures
the scattering of points and the eigenfaces example. At this level,
thinking of eigenvalues as capturing the importance of different
aspects of an operator is a good approach. It is also important to keep
in mind that spectral decomposition is a property of linear systems in general, not just matrices. 

In fact, the entirety of EE 315 is representation of functions using
an eigenbasis formed by the eigenfunctions of the derivative
operator. The parallels can be made formally exact (though with significant
technical effort and abstractions).
