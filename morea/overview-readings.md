This page collects together all of the "readings" associated with
individual modules.

In this site, readings represent the multiple perspectives that will
together provide a mental framework for you. These readings summarize
most of the important material.

Some readings from the textbook, others are handouts overlapping or
supplementing the text. The list of topics covered is not identical
to the text, just reading the text is insufficient. However, if you 
keep up with classes and understand the handouts, that will suffice.

Sometimes readings are assigned before the material is covered in
class. The expectation then is not that you understand everything,
but you seed yourself with an opinion on the subject.
